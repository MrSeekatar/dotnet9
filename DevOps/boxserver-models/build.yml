### Implementation Instructions ###
# 1. If you have not already done so, create a DevOps folder at the root of your code repository
# 2. In that folder, create another folder that will be the devops name of your deployable. this will coordinate
#    with your docker image name and your helm release name. e.g. connect-api, caerus-import-manager, hermes-message-sender
# 3. Copy this file to the root of the deployable folder, ensuring it is named build.yml
# 4. Find each TODO in this file and follow the instructions to provide the appropriate value for your deployable.

### Semantic Version ###
# This value represents the version of the build.
# The recommended format is to keep it in line with the devops-templates versioning. this will allow for scripted updates in the future.
# See the ref property on the loyal-templates repository in the resources section for that value.
name: "1.3.$(Rev:r)$(BuildSuffix)"

### Build Parameters ###
# Allows the use of non-default values in the event of a manually invoked build
parameters:

  # Specifies whether to to push the nupkg even if running manually
  # When set to `true`, the nupkg will be pushed.
  - name: isForcePush
    type: boolean
    displayName: Push the nupkg for manual builds
    default: false

### CI Triggers ###
# Provides rules for the branch and source control events will trigger the build.

trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - refs/heads/master
  paths:
    include:
      - 'src/BoxServerModels'

### PR Triggers ###
# Provides rules for the pull request events that will trigger the build.

### Pipeline Resources ###
# This section specifies the service connection details needed for using any external resources, namely the loyal-templates repository.
# This should reference the shared github connection that has been shared with each Azure DevOps project.
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: loyal-templates
      type: github
      name: loyalhealth/devops-templates
      ref: releases/v1.3
      # TODO:    update to the name of the shared github connection service connection in the Azure DevOps project.
      #          the suffix should be the name of the azure devops project.
      # EXAMPLE: github-connection-ConnectApi
      endpoint: github-connection-boxserver

### Template Extensions ###
# Each build pipeline should extend a loyal template that standardizes the build process.
# For details on the available templates, see the loyal-templates repository.
extends:
  template: build_dotnet-sdk.yml@loyal-templates
  parameters:
    # TODO:    update the app name for slack messages and job names
    # EXAMPLE: BackendTemplate
    appName: BoxServer
    # TODO:    update to the path to the csproj or mask of csproj files to build
    # EXAMPLE: src/BackendTemplateModels/BackendTemplateModels.csproj
    nugetPath: src/BoxServerModels/BoxServerModels.csproj
    isForcePush: ${{ parameters.isForcePush }}
    # default parameters
    # buildVersion: $(Build.BuildNumber)
